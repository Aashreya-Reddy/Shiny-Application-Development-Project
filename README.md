Spotify song recommendations with R shiny
Predicted mainstream hit music based on song features using an ensemble learning method, Random Forest Model with 10 fold cross validation to achieve an accuracy of 86%. Performed k-mean clustering to find different types of music such as acoustic, metal, mellow and mainstream music. Predicted the clusters using a multinomial logit model to attain an accuracy of 99.5%. Built an interactive shiny application for providing song recommendations based on the userâ€™s input and also created an interactive EDA and model building.
