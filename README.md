The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs, published weekly by Billboard magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales, radio play, and online streaming in the United States. These songs are considered to be a mainstream hit in the dataset which contain features of all the songs from Jan 1st,2010, ending at Dec 31st, 2019 which is extracted using a Spotify web API. 

Predicted mainstream hit music based on song features using an ensemble learning method, Random Forest Model with 10 fold cross validation to achieve an accuracy of 86%. Performed k-mean clustering to find different types of music such as acoustic, metal, mellow and mainstream music. Predicted the clusters using a multinomial logit model to attain an accuracy of 99.5%. Built an interactive shiny application for providing song recommendations based on the userâ€™s input and also created an interactive EDA and model building.
